    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The DMI internship program is a multimedia design and development training program for UT students.</p>

<p>Students will have the opportunity to learn from among a core set of digital media technologies including graphic design, animation, video production, motion graphics, 3D modeling, web development, and mobile development. Students will also collaborate with other students, learn multimedia production best practices, and work with clients on real-world instructional technology projects.</p>

<p>At the end of the program, students will have the opportunity to apply both for open positions at the Center for Teaching and Learning, and for internship opportunities with our internship partners.</p>
<h4>Department-specific Training</h4>
<p>DMI works with departments on campus to help fill specialized needs that they have for student interns.  Often these departments will request student interns with specific subject matter expertise, and DMI recruitment and training will be tailored to the needs of each department.</p>

<p>Department representatives or potential applicants should e-mail <a href="mailto:ctl-dmi@utlists.utexas.edu">ctl-dmi@utlists.utexas.edu</a> with any questions about department-specific training.</p>
